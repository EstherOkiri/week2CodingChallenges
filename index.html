    <h1>Week 2 Coding Challenges</h1>
    <a href="/2-1challenge.html">Coding Challenge 2.1</a>
    <p>Create a simple web page with a button and a paragraph element. When the button is clicked, 
        <br>the text content of the paragraph element should be changed to “Hello, World!”.</p>
    <a href="/2-2challenge.html">Coding Challenge 2.2</a>
    <p>Create a simple web page with two buttons, each with a different background color. When a button is clicked, <br>
        the background color of the page should change to the color of the clicked button. Additionally, if the user clicks <br>
        anywhere on the page outside of the buttons, the background color should return to its original color.</p>
    <a href="/2-3challenge.html">Coding Challenge 2.3</a>
    <p>Create an expandable list where clicking on a list item expands or collapses a sub-list. Use 
        event delegation to handle the click events on the parent list element, and bubbling to toggle the sub-list visibility.</p>
    <a href="/to-do-list.html">Coding Challenge 2.4</a>
    <p>For this project, we will create a simple to-do list application that allows users to add and remove tasks dynamically. The 
        user interface will consist of a text input field to add new tasks and a list of tasks that can be removed by clicking on them.</p>
